## What are Options and How to use them to Make Money

Stock Options broken down
A stock option gives an investor the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a stock at an agreed-upon price and date.  

        1. Puts
            1. Puts are bets that a stock or index will fall.
        2. Calls
            1. Calls are bets that a stock or index will rise.
        3. Epiration Dates
            1. Options do not only allow a trader to bet on a stock rising or falling but also enable the trader to choose a specific date when they expect the stock to rise or fall.
        4. Stirke Prices
            1. The strike price determines whether an option should be exercised. 
            2. It is the price that a trader expects the stock to be above or below by the expiration date.
        5. Contract Size
            1. Contracts represent a specific number of underlying shares that a trader may be looking to buy. One contract is equal to 100 shares of the underlying stock.
        6. Premium
            1. The premium is the price paid for an option, It is determined by taking the price of the call or puts and multiplying it by the number of contracts bought, then multiplying it by 100.
        7. Bid
            1. Bid is the amount of a premium that someone is willing to pay to purchase an option at a certain strike price.
        8. Ask
            1. Ask is the amount of a premium that someone is willing to sell an option at a certain strike price.

## Basic Idea of what I am thinking

I am executing an Option Play called a Bull Call Spread. Which is where you both Buy and Sell Options of a Stock for a premium at the same time.

Example of Bull Call Spread:
Ask = $0.17 per share at the Strike Price of $456.00
Bid = $0.09 per share at the strike Price of $457.00

Amount of Premium made is the difference between the Ask and the Bid.
Premium per share = $0.17 - $0.09 = $0.08 per share.
Premium per contract = $0.08 * 100 = $8.00 per contract.

Cost of Running Bull Call Spread:
Cost of play per share = (Bid Strike Price - Ask Strike Price)
Cost of Play per Share = $457 - $456 = $1
Cost per Contract = $1 * 100 shares per contract, which equals $100

So, Overall it would cost you $100 per contract of this play, And you collect $8 for every $100 risked. Which is a 8% return on you money.

And here is the Kicker: if you remember from the Explainations about Expiration Dates, if the Option is not exercised by the Expiration Date you then get the initial investment of your $100 invested.

## Next Step in Thinking

So, now we can take a look at *What is the Highest Percent return you can get why minimizing your chances of your options being exercised?*
