## Project gets proprietary from this point on

### But here is a General Idea of what I did

I will continue with the "Quick and Dirty" Dataset form this point on for the sake of this project. I will not being including code from here on out as I have not had the chance to code this out for python

Next Course of Action is to then find the range of Premiums that you could play that would maintain a High Percent return while staying far enough away from the Current price to get initial investment back.

So to do this with the "Quick & Dirty" dataset, I would recommend to use a NEAT algorithm.

A [N.E.A.T.](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) algorithm is also known as Neuro-Evolution of Augmentating Topologies, with is a form of a  Genetic Neural Network.

*In the Properitary side of the project I had access to tools that allowed me to use a Genetic Neural Network, which took about 2 & 1/2 weeks to get trained. The reaseon it took so long is because I used a Machine Learning - Random Forest Classifier, to verify if the Genetic Neural Network was moving in a positive direction as a Fitness Function for classifying the Options data.*
