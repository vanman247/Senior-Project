## Goals of the Project:
   1. To build a system that executes stock market options research.
   2. Build an application for applied use of system
	
## How to Achieve the goals of the Project:
  1.	Use python to code the logic of searching for a stock per option play
	a.	Stock Screener
		1. $1 strike prices difference
		2. No stocks that give dividends
		3. More than 1 million in open trade Volume
		4. Etc.…
		
  2.	Calculate Percent Return per play per stock
	a.	Bull Call Spread
		i.	Used for when Stock is going to Climb up in price.
	b.	Bear Put Spread
		i.	Used for when the stock is falling down in price.
	c.	Iron Condor
		i.	Used for when stock price is moving sideways.
  3.	Calculate Probabilities and Odds of stocks current price moving to play of the stock.
 
## Background:
	This will help to build my python and potentially SQL knowledge. And to help me with my logic statements of how to do something in either language. 
	I came to this idea by talking with my dad, me and him talk about business ideas that we have and how we would implement the idea in real life. We also talk about how we can make a passive income. Well, my dad made a comment that went something along the lines of “What if you could build a bot that instead of trading stocks would run Option plays instead”.
	This made me think about what I could do. In my mind it didn’t seem that hard, I would have to learn about Stocks and Options, then code a computer to detect what plays to run than I could write some simple code to execute the Plays.
	I thought on in more and more, and I the more I thought upon the more I thought of why not. So, I researched and from my research I couldn’t find anyone that was already do this. So, I said to myself “Let’s do this”.
	I then reached out to a Stock Broker and asked if I could shadow him and learn how he does what he does. So, I started learning about Stocks and Options. And he began to teach me how to do it. I then presented this Idea I had to him and he was on board with the idea.
